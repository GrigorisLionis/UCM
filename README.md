### UCM
UCM is an acronym for the UnContolled Manifold concept, which is a hypothesis on how the redundant kinematic mechanism of the human body moves.
The scope of this project is to implement the UCM apporoach on real human motion data.
## A short description of UCM
## Implementing the UCM approach
To solve the problem we used sympy toolbox to create a symbolic representation of the low kinematic chain. Alternatively we could have used the python robotics toolbox,but we opted for using sympy to have more direct understanding of the symbolic model produced.
